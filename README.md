# Mario-AI-Model-Using-Gaming-Reinforcement-Learning

The Mario AI Model project harnesses the power of reinforcement learning, employing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train an intelligent agent within the Mario video game environment. To optimize performance, innovative techniques such as greyscaling and vectorization are implemented. Greyscaling simplifies visual input by converting the colorful game environment into grayscale, while vectorization streamlines data processing. These efficiency enhancements, combined with the robust learning capabilities of PPO, enable the AI agent to rapidly acquire complex gameplay strategies, navigating obstacles and adversaries with precision. This project serves as a compelling showcase of how cutting-edge algorithms and optimization techniques can synergize to advance the field of AI-driven gaming.
